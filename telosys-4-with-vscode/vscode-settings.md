# VSCode settings

For greater ease of use, we suggest the following configuration&#x20;

### In VSCode Settings

To access "Settings" from the menu:  **File** -> **Preferences** -> **Settings**   or   \[**Ctrl**] + \[ **,** ]

In section "**Text Editor**" / "**Suggestions**" :&#x20;

* "**Snippet Suggestions**"\
  Choose "**top**" to show snippet suggestions on top of other suggestions

<div align="left">

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (2).png" alt="" width="563"><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

</div>

* "**Word Based Suggestions**" \
  Turn it "**off"** to obtain suggestions only from snippets (including those from Telosys extension).

<div align="left">

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

</div>

It's usually enough to get a clearest view of snippets suggestion.

If you want to go further, have a look at the following options:&#x20;

* Editor › **Suggest: Show Words**&#x20;
* Editor › **Suggest: Filter Graceful**
* Editor: **Quick Suggestions**

# Telosys terminal in VSCode



Visual Studio Code includes a full featured integrated terminal that starts at the root of your workspace.

See https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/terminal/basics&#x20;

This terminal is the ideal place to launch and use Telosys-CLI. So you can run all Telosys-CLI commands while staying in VSCode.

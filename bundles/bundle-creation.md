# Bundle creation

The easiest way to create a new bundle is to copy and customize an existing one.

To do this, simply copy the entire bundle directory under the name of your choice, then customize the files to suit your needs.

If you want to create an empty bundle, follow these steps:

* Create the **bundle directory** in the Telosys bundles location ( "TelosysTools/templates" by default)&#x20;
* In this new directory&#x20;
  * Copy an existing "**templates.cfg**" file and adapt it
  * Create a "**README.md**" file (optional)
  * Create (or copy/paste/modify) the **templates** files ("**.vm**" files) \
    and reference each template in "templates.cfg"

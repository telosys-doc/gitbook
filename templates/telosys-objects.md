# Telosys objects

Telosys provides a set of predefined objects usable in the templates :

* Objects giving access to the current model ( $model, $entity, $attribute, $link, etc )
* Utility functions and tools ( $fn, $loader )
* Generation environment ( $env, $project, $target, etc )
* Functions dedicated to certain types of generation ($java, $h2, $jpa, etc)

The documentation reference for each object is available here :\

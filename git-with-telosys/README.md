You can use Git to manage your models and bundles of templates.&#x20;

By default, Telosys uses GitHub to provide sample templates and bundles that can be installed with "im" and "ib" commands.

For GitHub depots and personal acces token see "[GitHub usage](github-usage.md)".

If you want to use Git repositories on your workstation for templates and bundles, \
see “[install with Git](git-as-an-external-tool/clone-with-git.md)” and "[publish with Git](git-as-an-external-tool/publish-with-git.md)".

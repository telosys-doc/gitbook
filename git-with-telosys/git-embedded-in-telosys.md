# Git embedded in Telosys

Since version 4.3.0 Telosys-CLI is able to execute Git commands by itself, even if no Git tool is intalled on your workstation.

Git is embedded in Telosys-CLI in order to simplify Git usage to **clone**, **init** and **publish** models and bundles repositories.

&#x20;**`git`**  is the command to execute git operations.

For help with Git commands, type   **`? git`**   in Telosys-CLI .

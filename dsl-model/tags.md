# Tags

Each attribute can have **0 to N tags**. 

Like annotations, tags provide additional information usable during the code generation.   
But, unlike annotations, tags do not have predefined names.  
The user can define as many tags as he wants.

A tag is **any name** starting with "**\#**" and optionally having a value.  
If a tag must have a **value** then it is defined between "**\(**" and "**\)**".

Examples of tags :

```text
#myTag
#foo
#weight(12)
#description("bla bla")
```

**Welcome developer friend!**&#x20;



In this documentation, you will find how to install and configure Telosys-CLI, how to use it with VS-Code or any other JetBrains IDE, how to create and customize your models and of course how to generate your code.

There is also a lot of more detailed information on creating or adapting template bundles to generate any type of code or text (programming languages, SQL, documentation, etc.)

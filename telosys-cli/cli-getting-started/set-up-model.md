# Set up a model

To generate application code, you need a **model** containing the **entities** of your business domain.

There are 3 ways to set up a Telosys model :&#x20;

* **create a new model from scratch** \
  an empty model in which you can then create the entities you need&#x20;
* **create a new model from an existing relational database** : \
  a model created from the database schema (1 entity for each table)
* **install an existing model from a depot** \
  download and install a Git repository containing the model&#x20;

For more information, see pages "[Model creation](../../models/model-creation.md)" and "[Model installation](../../models/model-installation.md)"



### Main commands for model management

Models management is based on "Model commands" and "Entity commands".

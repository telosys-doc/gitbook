# Model creation

Since version 4.0 Telosys manages on only one type of model : \
the model based on the Telosys DSL (Domain-Specific Language).

There are 2 ways to create a Telosys model :&#x20;

* **from scratch** : \
  an empty model in which you can then create the entities you need&#x20;
* **from an existing relational database** : \
  a model created from the database schema (1 entity for each table)

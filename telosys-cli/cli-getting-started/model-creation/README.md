# Model creation

Telosys supports 2 kinds of models :&#x20;

* **DSL model** : a pure text model based on a simple grammar that can be created from scratch&#x20;
* **Database model** : a model initialized from an existing database (the database schema is the model)

So there are 2 different ways to create a model depending on the type of model you want.

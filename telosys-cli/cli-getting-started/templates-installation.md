# Set up a bundle of templates

Once you have a model you need at least one **bundle of templates** to generate your code.

The templates are organized in "bundles". A **"bundle"** is a set of templates designed to generate a particular kind of targets.

Of course you can create your own templates from scatch, but the simplest way to start is to use existing templates. To do so, see "[Bundles installation](../../bundles/bundles-installation.md)"



### Main commands for bundles management

Bundles management is based on "**Bundle commands**" and "**Template commands**".

See page  "[Bundles management](../../bundles/bundles-management.md)".

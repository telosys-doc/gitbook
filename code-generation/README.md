# Code generation

To generate your code you can use the following commands:

* **`gen`** to generate code with the current model and the current bundle\
  see  [gen command syntax](gen-command.md)&#x20;
* **`genb`** to generate code in "batch mode" (since ver 4.1.0) with multiple models and/or bundles\
  see  [genb command syntax](genb-command.md)&#x20;
